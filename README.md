Word Occurrences
=========

An [interactive visualization of the number of word occurrences in various public domain texts](http://rbauer1.github.io/wordOccurrences/).


This code is heavily borrowed from [the d3.js Bubble Chart example](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/bubble.html) by [@mbostock](http://twitter.com/mbostock) and [the interactive exoplanet visualization](http://codementum.org/exoplanets/) by [Lane Harrison](https://github.com/codementum/exoplanets).
